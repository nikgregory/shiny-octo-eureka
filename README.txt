Some tips:

* The theme is based on Genesis, although you won't find too many
  references to Genesis in the theme, they have all been removed. But,
  the docs for Genesis mostly all apply, just use some lateral thinking.

* For dark style themes there's a dark.css file, just uncomment it in the info file.

* If you have some problem with the theme settings, clear the cache and/or the
  theme registry
  
* If you don't use Firebug then get it now, this theme has many pre written CSS
  selectors. The theme was designed for porting right from the get go and makes it
  really easy as long as you don't fight the workflow, embrace it:)
